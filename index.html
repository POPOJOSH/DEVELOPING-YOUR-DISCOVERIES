        <p> DEVELOPING YOUR DISCOVERIES is not intended by the author to be an historical study of 
            materials on discoveries. Rather, the book is intended to serve as a
            mysterious key, tool, and weapon to weary and discouraged hearts,
            challenging them to arise to the task of developing their discoveries, as
            the Lord has commanded us to occupy till he comes.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            DEVELOPING YOUR DISCOVERIES is also further intended to
            fan and stoke the embers of purpose fulfilment in the hearts of those
            who are already on this lonely path of pursuit of the genuine glory of
            God, and becoming all that the divinity has destined for humanity here
            on earth before the ultimate transition. This book will hopefully
            awaken a genuine desire in the human heart to deepen personal
            search and study on how to “develop all the deposited virtues
            (discoveries) in one's life!

            Every line starts with a dot, and every circle starts with a point.
            There would not be an end without a beginning. Such is the life of man.
            There would not be fulfilment of purpose, if there is no purpose in the
            first place.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            There would not be manifestation of whatsoever great things
            man has achieved or would still achieve, if there has not been
            imagination of such things first. Though it's manifestation that attracts
            the applause of men and worth celebrating, but there wouldn't have
            been such celebration without imagination. And manifestation is not
            attained by a sudden flight; it's only actualized through the right
            processes. It's the following of the due processes that will bring the
            demanded products to a reality and manifestation. Such is the
            discoveries of man, and the development thereof.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            It's not enough to have a good and beautiful pictures
            snapped, and remain in the camera's film, as negative. It is far
            more important, and great to have them washed, and printed,
            to be seen. More so, it is not enough to have the plan of a good
            mansion building, to be drawn on a paper, it's more beautiful,
            great and important, though demanding, to have it physically
            built, erected, and developed on the land, to be seen as a full
            building. But, this erecting, building, and developing is not
            achieved suddenly. It must follow the due processes to attain
            the required and desired expectation, which is the mansion. So
            also is the DEVELOPING OF YOUR DISCOVERIES.

            keys to help you develop all your discoveries, all to the glory of
            God, and fulfill the purpose of your being, by taking your dream

            Let's catch the revival fire, by developing our discoveries,
            and work tirelessly for our King and His Kingdom, for “…THE
